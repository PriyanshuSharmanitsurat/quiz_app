i have thought of how it will work     

                                      QUIZFORALL


a home page(landing page)- with multiple options on the top at navbar like - login/signup ,service page,home button,aboutus etc
login and signup screen-it will be stored in postgres sql and hashing will be done by bcrypt-> and after login user will be taken to its personal dashboard
about us ->it will be a simple page and first we will add just fake data to it
working--so basically in this app we will ask user question based on their input, like if we will ask them first their topic and then their level of topic and the number of question (max 20) and time will be given 2 min per question, for example use will enter ,differential equation and they will enter 11 class or btech 2nd sem or mtech  and number of question(5-20), so based on that data we will ask them question, for this we will use google gemini api, and time will be given 2 min per question, and if the user scores less then 80% then we will suggest user a youtube video of the topic( first video that comes in the youtube after that topic is serched ).  and this data of user will be saved on postgres sql . and the user will only be able to give test after login or signup. and other functionality of the app will be added.
help page-- working of help page will be simple . user will submit a form with username, and query to resolve, and this data will be send to a email(useremail).
notification page--admin will be able to notification to user with a username and the data of notification .
 

backend apis
1) login and signup apis-
2)fetching questions api - using gemini
3) fetching youtube video api- using topic and level a prompt will be generated , and using this a link of video will be fetched
4)help page api- email will be send to a email address with query in it.
5)fetching notification-it will fetch notification for user from database
5)notification api-(for admin) admin will send notification to username and this notification will be added to database of user.
6) fetching data of every user-(for admin) admin can get data of every user with username and every data of user.


frontend
1)first there will be home page which will display a nav bar with a logo on left corner and on right side it will have options like - login/signup,help, a notification tab,aboutus.
and after that the body of home page will have a option for "start a test". on which when user will click it will redirect to login and signup page
2) login and signup page- signup will ask user -username(which should be unique , means it should not user to add their data on database with same username),email address,password,enter password again.after signup user data will be added in postgresql and them user will be asked its details like- name ,mobile number,DOB. 
 3)after login/signup user will be directed to its dashboard .
4) on user dashboard user will be shown its data. for ex. profile notification bar , and test attemted ,avereage score, videos watced etc.
5) there will be a option to attemt test on which when user clicks user will be redirted to a form submittion with topic and level of topic and number of questions , after user clickes on get questions, user will be given a number of questions (all mcq) and time will be given (2 min per question) . 
6) after the quiz is over the user will be provides with scores and a detailed solution of every question (generated from gemini), and a youtube video if score is <80%.
7) and this data will added to database


database
1) first table will be of user information
2) second table will be user data of quiz(relational database)

so this will be our project 
so now just make a clear breif of it , do not write code now , we will do it later 
 and tell me if it possible or not
